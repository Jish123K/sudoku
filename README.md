Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary libraries such as NumPy and Pygame. You can install these libraries using pip command:

Copy code

pip install numpy pygame

Step 2: Generate a Sudoku Board

Create a function that generates a Sudoku board. You can use NumPy to create a 9x9 array and fill it with random values from 1-9.

Step 3: Validate the Board

Create a function that validates whether the Sudoku board is valid or not. The board is valid if each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1-9 without any repetition.

Step 4: Create a User Interface

Create a graphical user interface using Pygame. Create a grid of 81 cells that represents the Sudoku board. You can use different colors to distinguish between the original and the user-entered cells.

Step 5: Allow User to Input Numbers

Create an event loop that allows the user to input numbers using the mouse and keyboard. When the user clicks on a cell, highlight it, and allow the user to input a number from 1-9 using the keyboard.

Step 6: Check the User Input

Create a function that checks whether the user input is valid or not. The input is valid if it does not violate the rules of Sudoku.

Step 7: Solve the Sudoku Puzzle

Create a function that solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm should backtrack and try different values until it finds a solution.
Step 8: Display the Solution

Display the solution to the Sudoku puzzle when the user clicks on the solve button. Highlight the cells that are part of the solution.

Step 9: Allow User to Reset the Game

Create a reset button that allows the user to reset the game. When the user clicks on the reset button, clear all the user-entered cells and generate a new Sudoku board.
